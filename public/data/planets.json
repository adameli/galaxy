        "title": "Venus",
        "info": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size to Earth. However, it has a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, causing a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the Solar System. Venus rotates slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets."

        "title": "Earth",
        "info": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known place to support life. It has a diverse ecosystem with land, oceans, and an atmosphere that provides the necessary conditions for sustaining organisms. Earth's surface is mostly covered by water, and its atmosphere shields life from harmful solar radiation."

        "title": "Mars",
        "info": "Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is known as the 'Red Planet' due to its iron-rich soil. It has the largest volcano in the Solar System and features dry, dusty terrain. Mars has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, and it is a key focus in the search for past or present life."

        "title": "Jupiter",
        "info": "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with a prominent feature called the Great Red Spot, a massive storm. Jupiter has at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean moons, one of which (Europa) may harbor an ocean beneath its icy surface."

        "title": "Saturn",
        "info": "Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is famous for its stunning ring system, made of ice and rock particles. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. It has numerous moons, with Titan being the largest and having a thick atmosphere of its own."

        "title": "Uranus",
        "info": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is unique for its sideways rotation. It is an ice giant, with an atmosphere containing hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it a blue-green color. Uranus has a faint ring system and several moons, and it takes about 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun."

    {
        "title": "Neptune",
        "info": "Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. It is another ice giant with strong winds and storms, including the dark Great Spot similar to Jupiter's. Neptune has a deep blue color due to methane in its atmosphere and is home to 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest."
